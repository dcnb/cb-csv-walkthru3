# Build Your Digital Collection with CollectionBuilder

Welcome! 🎉 This tutorial will guide you through creating a digital collection website using **CollectionBuilder**—a framework that transforms metadata into beautiful, searchable websites with maps, timelines, and visualizations.

You'll work entirely in **GitHub Codespaces** (a cloud-based development environment), so no software installation is required!

## About the Psychiana Collection

This tutorial uses demo data from the **Psychiana Digital Collection** at the University of Idaho Library. Psychiana was a popular 20th-century mail-order "New Thought" religion founded by Frank B. Robinson in Moscow, Idaho (1928-1948). The collection includes 66 items: photographs, radio programs, advertisements, and correspondence.
